<p>Le 975, a modern bistro in the 18th arrondissement, has been making waves since 2022 with its €24 lunch menu. Chef Taiki Tamao, a former protégé of Marc Veyrat, offers creative and evolving French cuisine. Signature dishes like the butternut squash velouté with a perfect egg have already won over food lovers. In the evening, a €59 tasting menu explores the best of French gastronomy. Wine connoisseur Mathieu Orazi completes the experience with a carefully curated organic wine list. With its minimalist decor, Le 975 has established itself as a must-visit destination.</p>

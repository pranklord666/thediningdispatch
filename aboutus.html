    <h2><span>ABOUT US</span></h2>
    <p>
        Hey there! We’re two Parisians, born and raised, and we know this city like the back of our hands. After years of working as waiters in fancy-looking restaurants that overcharged tourists for bad food and pushed for tips (so un-French!), we decided to do something about it.
    </p>
    <p>
        That’s how <strong>The Dining Dispatch</strong> was born: to help you dodge the tourist traps and eat like a local.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our recommendations are fresh, reliable, and perfect for exploring on the go. So, grab your fork and let’s dive into the real Paris. Bon appétit!

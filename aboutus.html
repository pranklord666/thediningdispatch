    <h2><span>ABOUT US</span></h2>
    <p>
        At The Dining Dispatch, we don’t just show you the plate — we take you behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
        We’re curious about what happens before a dish arrives at the table — the people, the places, the process. From the early prep to the late-night cleanups, from the chef’s story to the hidden energy of the kitchen, we capture the life of a restaurant beyond what’s usually seen.
    </p>
    <p>
        We’ve started filming in New York and Paris, and we’re now hitting the road for a four-month journey across Africa to meet the teams behind some incredible restaurants and local gems.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Dining Dispatch is a food project for the curious. It’s not about stars or hype — it’s about stories, craft, and what makes a place feel alive.
